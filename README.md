# ‚òòÔ∏è (2025) GreenTech Globalton NodeJS
**Team 3: High-Hackers**

Our system seamlessly integrates Flutter for the front-end with Express.js, Flask, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for the back-end.

By leveraging our AI models, our hardware can instantly detect forest fires, enabling managers to monitor and assess affected areas in real time through our app.

**Key Features**
   1.	**Real-Time Monitoring**
Administrators can interact with a central map in the app to view management areas and select devices for real-time wildfire monitoring and risk analysis.

   2.	**Future Expansion**
We aim to enhance our system with an integrated AI monitoring network, utilizing drones and satellites for precise wildfire detection and climate change adaptation strategies.

## üõ†Ô∏è CI/CD pipeline

### **GCP Cloud Build & GitHub Actions**
For GCP Cloud Build, you must follow these steps.

1. **Open cloudbuild.yaml**

2. **'your-*' part needs to be modified**
   ```bash
   steps:
   # 1. Install dependancy
   - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/npm'
       args: ['install']

   # 2. Update your repository using 'git pull'
   - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud'
      args:
         - 'compute'
         - 'ssh'
         - 'your-vm-instance'
         - '--zone'
         - 'your-vm-instance-timezone'
         - '--command'
         - |
           git config --global --add safe.directory /home/your-github-account/greentech_globalthon_nodejs && \
           cd /home/your-github-account/greentech_globalthon_nodejs && git pull

   # 3. Restart your server using pm2
   - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud'
      args:
         - 'compute'
         - 'ssh'
         - 'your-vm-instance'
         - '--zone'
         - 'your-vm-instance-timezone'
         - '--command'
         - |
           cd /home/your-github-account/greentech_globalthon_nodejs && \
           npx pm2 reload all

   # logsBucket
   logsBucket: 'gs://your-bucket-name' 
   ```

## üóÇÔ∏è Project architecture
![project-architecture-image](public/architecture.png)

1. **Client request**  
   - When a user sends a request, it is routed to the Express.js server through the GCP Load Balancer.
2. **GCP Express.js server**  
   - The Express.js server handles CRUD operations by communicating with MySQL Cloud SQL.  
3. **High-Hackers Flask server**  
   - The Flask detecting server utilizes the Mobilenet v3 model to detect precise forest fires in real time.
